# RUL-Of-Ball-Bearings
Forecasting Remaining Usable Life Of Vehicle Bearing for Enhanced Production and Reduced Maintenance Costs
This study using Python Programming Language, estimates the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of ball
bearings in various vehicle applications, like electric motors and gear drives. By analyzing factors such as
load, speed, and operating hours, we found that reducing shift hours increased bearing RUL by 25%. Finally,
this study helps optimize machine operation and cost-effective maintenance strategies for vehicle systems.
